export default `Some things never change.  Ever since I was a young child, 
I could always be characterized by an insatiable desire to understand 
and learn new things, extreme attention to detail, an obsession with 
finding innovative and elegant solutions to problems, and the ability 
to interact with a screen (for far too long, as my parents would say), 
seemingly without the need to blink.  Somewhere along the road, perhaps 
unsurprisingly, these have led me to invest in teaching myself to code.   
Since then, it’s something that I have rapidly developed a knack and a passion 
for, and that’s something not likely to change, either!`
